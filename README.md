# ngdb - A Python library for reading Norton Guide database files

## Introduction

Back in the mists of time, in the days of MS-DOS and Clipper programming,
[Norton Guide database files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides)
were a very popular form of hypertext help. Lots of information is still
kicking around inside such files.

This library is another in [a reasonably long line of tools I've written to
help keep that information available](http://www.davep.org/norton-guides/).

## TODO

As you might be able to tell, this is just a work-in-progress project, it's
far from finished. When it's finished, this text won't be here. Until then,
expect utter chaos.
