# ngdb - A Python library for reading Norton Guide database files

## Introduction

Back in the mists of time, in the days of MS-DOS and Clipper programming,
Norton Guide database files were a very popular form of hypertext help. Lots
of information is still kicking around inside such files.

This library is another in a reasonably long line of tools I've written to
help keep that information available.

## TODO

As you might be able to tell, this is just a work-in-progress project, it's
far from finished. When it's finished, this text won't be here. Until then,
expect utter chaos.
